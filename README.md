I thought it was going to be super hard to implement and parallelize, but it turns out that thanks to Rust and the fact that you can calculate each pixel independently it was super simple to implement and get working. 

Since it took me much less time than I expected I'll try to use a better algorithm, maybe even try and make animations with it, we'll see.
